## Objective
This repository provides a visualization of the data gathered from public datasets. In the context of aging population, dependent population refers to the non-earning population. This includes children and the elderly. It is observed that in BC the elderly dependent population in increasing while that of the children dependent population is dwindling. This can have adverse effects on the economy of the province. The effects are shown in the aspects of healthcare expenses. These are shown in the context of the expenditure in other Canadian provinces for context. The effects of aging could also have political implications. This is inferred from the voter participation trends in the provincial elections held every 4 years. The senior dependent population of the province clear participates heavily as compared to the working population. With an increase in the elderly dependent population, the political mandates and vote bank politics might change in the forthcoming years to satisfy the needs of the elderly citizens. This forecasted dependency trend indicates that the elderly dependency ration in BC could be as high as 0.45 in 2041. That means that nearly half of the BC population will be elderly dependents. The implications of this are for the audience to infer!
