> Author: Ranjitprakash Sundaramurthi

## Objective
The objective of this repository is to use the public datasets to visualize the trends in the aging population in BC and the trends in the voters participation in BC General Elections. Specifically observe the participation by age groups. Create visualization that can provide answers to some of the following questions:
* Which age-group currently participates the most in general elections and what has been their trend over the years?
* What is the trend of the population age distribution? How will this influence the participation numbers in the future general elections?
* Will the senior citizens form a majority of the voting citizens in the future elections?
* Can the election candidates adapt their campaigns to age-grooups?
* If senior citizens will be majority voters, which aspect of their lives need attention and focus from the election candidates during the campaign?
